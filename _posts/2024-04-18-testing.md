$$\sum_{n=0}^{n=\infty}$$

I see so if it's continually updating based on the changes that I make, then this actually isn't a bad way to represent latex at all. In fact, one could say this is quite a desirable way to write up latex.

Yep, this feels *much* more comfortable as a workflow then having to work in wordpress. I'm undecided on whether I will make the switch over to this permanently, but considering that this setup process went relatively smoothly
and the words are just flowing much more easiliy in this format, I will at least be seriously considering it.

And if I have the tab open, how often does it refresh? I guess I have to hit the refresh button at the very least.

This is fairly fast. Ohh I think I have to save? Ahhhh whenever I save, *that's* when it triggers!

Yep, I definitely like this workflow way better than having to work with wordpress.

$$ f(x) = \begin{cases}
1 & \quad x < -1 \\
0 & \quad -1 \le x \le 1 \\
1 & \quad x > 1 \\
\end{cases} 
$$
